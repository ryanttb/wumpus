A website to play music, in folders, on a web server, without indexing.

One web service, with one REST resource representing a directory/file tree + HTML5 = music!

Indexing services can be nice but they can also seem slow and unreliable between services, e.g., Twonky, and devices (looking at you, Xbox). If you know where your music is (like the olde days), you should be able to just play it from anywhere.
